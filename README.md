Allows you to unobtrusively memoize simple methods.

## Usage
```ruby
class Counter
  extend Pakiderm

  memoize \
  def increment
    @sum = 1 + @sum.to_i
  end
end
```
Your method will only be called the first time, the result will be stored and returned on subsequent invocations.
```irb
counter = Counter.new
=> Counter

counter.increment
=> 1

counter.increment
=> 1
```
You can also pass a list of methods that should be memoized:
```ruby
memoize :complex_calculation, :api_response, :db_query
```

## Background
Pakiderm adds a method by using `Module#prepend` in order to"intercept" calls to the original method and provide memoization.

### Caveat
If you override the method in a subclass, Pakiderm's method won't be able to intercept calls to the subclass' method.
