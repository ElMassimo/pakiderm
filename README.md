Allows you to memoize simple methods and works only on ruby 2.0 or greater.

## Usage
```ruby
class Counter
  extend Pakiderm

  def increment
    @sum = 1 + @sum.to_i
  end

  memoize :increment, assignable: true
end
```
Your method will only be called the first time, the result will be stored and returned on subsequent invocations.
```irb
counter = Counter.new
=> Counter

counter.increment
=> 1

counter.increment
=> 1

counter.increment = 5
=> 5

counter.increment
=> 5
```
As you can see, you can also pass the `assignable` option, so that the memoized methods also provide an assignment operator to override the memoized value :smiley:.

## Background
Pakiderm uses `Module#prepend` to add the memoized method before yours in the method lookup path of your class. Your method is called by using 'super', because the class is an ancestor to the prepended module.

### Corolary
If you override a memoized method in a derived class, you alter the method chain, so the derived method won't be memoized unless you invoke memoize in the derived class as well.
